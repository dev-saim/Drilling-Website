    <h3>HOW DEEP DO WE NEED TO DRILL?</h3>

      <p>
        We always drill down to the aquifer – on average around 100-150 ft, although sometimes this can be more or less. This is because that’s where you find the most stable supply of water.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some water well drilling companies only drill down to the water table. This does cost less and means they often won’t need to drill through the clay layer, which can be notoriously tricky. However, the water table can be subject to surface weather fluctuations, that can affect the water supply.
      </p>

      <p>
        We want our wells to last a lifetime and beyond plus offer you the stability you need from a water supply.

        <h3>Well Competion Options</h3>
      <p>
        We basically have two types of well heads. Steel Sleeve (or well seal) and Pitless Adapters. The steel sleeve
        well has been the most commonly used well head in the area. It is simple and efficient. And if you are
        installing a big commercial well, this is the only way to go. But, if you don’t want to have to worry about your
        pipes freezing, then you should consider a pitless adapter. The water pipe exits the well underground, so there
        is no pipe to insulate. And the well head is much smaller, so it is easy on the eyes.

        <h3>How Does A Water Borehole Work?</h3>

      <p>
        First we drill down to the aquifer, this can be around 100-150 ft but can vary quite a lot depending on your area’s geology. Once we’ve drilled the borehole it’s cased, sealed and lined.
      </p>
      <p>
        We fit a well screen and just above a submersible pump. The pump lifts the water up through the rising main then along the discharge pipe to the pressure tank. The well water is stored in the pressure tank, where it goes on to supply your home.
